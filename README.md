# Image Captioning Web Application

Overview
This project is a web application deployed using FastAPI that utilizes deep learning techniques to generate captions for images. Users can upload images from their local device or submit an image URL to receive a descriptive caption.

Features
- Image Upload: Users can upload images directly from their devices.
- Image URL Submission: Users can enter an image URL to generate captions.
- Caption Generation: The application generates captions for the uploaded images using a trained model.

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/YoussefMArco/Image-Caption-Generator.git
   cd Image-Caption-Generator
2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
1. Start the web server:
   python app.py
2. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
3. Upload an image or enter an image URL and click "Upload and Generate Caption" to view the generated caption.

Example
Here's an example of an image caption generated by the application:
